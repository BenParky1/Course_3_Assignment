Week 1 Observations

Assumptions made before starting the analysis were that spending and remunerations would have a direct effect on the number of loyalty points earned by the customers. There is a relationship between spending and loyalty and remuneration and loyalty. This is no relationship between age and loyalty though

Week 2 Observations

From the initial pairplot before the Elbow or Silhouette Models had been used it was apparent that there could be 5 distinct clusters. The Silhouette and Elbow Models supported this theory, with the elbow flattening out at 5 or 6, and the Sihouette peaking at 5. The number of observations is more evenly distributed with 5 clusters, and this also splits out what looks like 4 distinct types of customer. Low Spend, low remuneration; high spend, low remuneration; low spend, high remuneration; and high spend, high remuneration. 3 and 4 clusters were grouping some of these customers into the same cluster, and I feel that to answer the business question "how groups within the customer base can be used to target specific market segments", these would be better analysed seperately.
